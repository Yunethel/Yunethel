<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<h4>CHIFFON CAKE</h4>
<p>▢6 large eggs</p>
<p>▢½ teaspoon cream of tartar</p>
<p>▢150 g granulated sugar, divided into 100g + 50g</p>
<p>▢50 g milk, dairy or non-dairy</p>
<p>▢50 g light-tasting oil</p>
<p>▢1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p>▢2 drops red or pink gel food colouring</p>
<p>▢120 g cake flour</p>
<p>▢½ teaspoon baking powder</p>
<h4>FILLING</h4>
<p>▢350 g whipping cream</p>
<p>▢35 g powdered sugar</p>
<p>▢1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p>▢500 g fresh strawberries, finely diced, plus more for topping</p>
<h4>CHIFFON CAKE</h4>
<p>1. Prep: Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 12x17" baking tray with parchment paper on the bottom only and set aside.</p>
<p>2. Separate eggs: Separate the egg whites and egg yolks into two separate large mixing bowls. Set the bowl of egg yolks aside.</p>
<p>3. Beat egg whites: To the egg whites, add cream of tartar. Use an electric hand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment to beat the egg whites until they become frothy like cappuccino foam.</p>
<p>4. Left to right: egg whites in a mixing bowl, foamy egg whites in a mixing bowl.</p>
<p>5. Add sugar: Sprinkle in 100g of sugar, one spoonful at a time, mixing well in between each addition. After all the sugar has been added, add 1-2 drops of pink gel food colouring and continue beating the egg whites until they become stiff peaks. Set aside.</p>
<p>6. Left to right: sprinkling sugar into bowl of egg whites while beating with hand mixer, pink meringue with stiff peaks in a mixing bowl.</p>
<p>7. Mix egg yolk mixture: To the egg yolks, add the remaining 50g of sugar and use the same hand mixer to mix until combined. Add milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Mix again until combined.</p>
<p>8. Sift in dry ingredients: Use a fine mesh sieve to sift the flour and baking powder into the egg yolk mixture. Mix on low speed until combined and smooth.</p>
<p>9.Fold meringue into egg yolk mixture: Add ⅓ of the meringue to the egg yolk mixture. Use a silicone spatula to gently fold them together until just combined to create a looser consistency. Add the rest of the meringue and fold until no streaks remain and the batter is fluffy and airy. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl where the egg yolk batter tends to settle.</p>
<p>10. Left to right: a dollop of meringue in a bowl of egg yolk mixture, folding meringue and egg yolk mixture together with a spatula.</p>
<p>11. Fill pan: Pour the batter into your lined baking tray. Use an offset spatula to spread the batter into the corners of the tray and smooth it into a flat, even layer.</p>
<p>12. Left to right: pouring chiffon cake batter into a baking tray, smoothing cake batter into a baking tray with an offset spatula.</p>
<p>13. Bake: Bake for 12-13 minutes or until the edges of the cake are lightly golden brown.</p>
<p>14. Release the cake sheet: Let the cake cool for just a few minutes before immediately running an offset spatula around the edges of the cake to release the sides from the pan. Flip the cake out of the pan onto a wire rack and peel the parchment paper off. Place a new sheet of parchment paper on top and flip the cake sheet back onto the parchment so that the side that was originally on top is back on top.</p>
<p>15. Left to right: running an offset spatula around the edge of baking tray, peeling parchment paper off of a cake sheet.</p>
<p>16. Roll up cake sheet: Use a knife to cut off the brown edges on the two short ends of the cake sheet. Starting at one of the short ends, roll up the cake sheet with the parchment paper and set aside to let it cool completely resting in this rolled-up log shape.</p>
<p>17. Left to right: hands rolling a cake sheet up, hands holding up rolled-up cake to show the side view.</p>
<h4>WHIPPED CREAM</h4>
<p>1. Whip cream: In a large mixing bowl, add whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Use an electric hand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment to whip the cream until it becomes firm peaks.</p>
<p>2. Left to right: whipping cream and ingredients in a bowl with a hand mixer, a bowl of whipped cream with firm peaks.</p>
<p>3. Spread whipped cream: Unroll the cooled cake sheet. Use an offset spatula to spread a generous and even layer of whipped cream on top of the cake sheet, leaving about 2" at one end empty. Reserve a small amount of whipped cream to decorate the top of the swiss roll the next day (optional).</p>
<p>4. Left to right: adding whipped cream onto cake sheet with a spatula, spreading whipped cream across cake sheet with an offset spatula.</p>
<p>5. Add strawberries: Evenly distribute the diced strawberries across the whipped cream layer, pressing them down into the cream to help them stick.</p>
<p>6. Left to right: hand sprinkling diced strawberries on top of whipped cream, pressing strawberries into whipped cream layer with a spatula.</p>
<p>7. Roll up cake: Roll up the cake in the same way it was rolled before. When you get to the end, use an offset spatula to scrape away any filling that squishes out before letting the cake roll rest with the seam of the roll on the bottom. Any filling that squishes out of the two ends of the roll can also be pushed back in.</p>
<p>8. Left to right: hands rolling up cake roll, pushing whipped cream into the ends of a cake roll with a spatula.</p>
<p>9. Chill: Wrap the roll in plastic wrap, reshape the roll with your hands if needed, and let it chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight to let the filling set.</p>
<p>10. Cut off ends: Once chilled, unwrap the cake. Slice about ½" off the two ends of the roll to reveal the swirl design.</p>
<p>11. Left to right: hands unraveling plastic wrap from a chilled swiss roll, cutting off the end of a swiss roll with a knife.</p>
<p>12. Decorate: Transfer the whipped cream you saved to a piping bag fitted with a piping tip of your choice. Pipe the cream on top of the cake and garnish with whole or halved strawberries.</p>
<p>13. Left to right: piping whipped cream on top of a swiss roll cake, hand placing a strawberry onto of a swiss roll.</p>
<p>14. Slice: Slice the swiss roll into 6-8 slices before serving.</p>
